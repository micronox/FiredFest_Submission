"""QuizCat — a Textual TUI for CCAT-style practice quizzes.

Module map
----------
``main.py``      App subclass and entry point (this file). Owns global
                 concerns only: title, theme, root key bindings, initial
                 dashboard screen.
``screens.py``   ``Screen`` subclasses. A screen is one "page" of the app
                 and is responsible for high-level state.
``widgets.py``   Reusable composable widgets (Q/A panel, control bar, the
                 labeled meters). Pure presentation — no quiz state.
``quizcat.tcss`` Stylesheet. Rules are organised top-down to follow the
                 reader's eye down the quiz screen.

Run from a uv-managed checkout with::

    uv run python main.py
